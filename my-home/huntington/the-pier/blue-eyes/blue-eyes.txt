Blue eyes
Thatâ€™s all I see
When I close mine
And I think that 
You are the most 
Beautiful thing
I have ever loved.

Blue eyes
In my dreams
Hold me tight
And tell me things
Will be alright 
Please don't leave me
When I wake up.

Blue eyes
Where did you go?
Blue eyes
I wanna hold you close.
Blue eyes
I miss you the most.
Blue eyes
Come back home
To me.
