If you can safely get to a sturdy building, then do so immediately. Go to a safe room, basement, or storm cellar. If you are in a building with no basement, then get to a small interior room on the lowest level.Stay away from windows, doors, and outside walls. Do not get under an overpass or bridge. Youâ€™re safer in a low, flat location. Watch out for flying debris that can cause injury or death. Use your arms to protect your head and neck.
